		<h2> About me! </h2> <br>
		<p>I have just graduated from my bachelors in Bioinformatics and I'm learning to be a web developer. I have completed most of my front end. I'm really passionate about this. I made this portfolio to showcase my html and css skills.
		I'm eager to learn more and gain some experience. </p>
